# Welcome

Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio repository. The website is live on (<https://www.jerryzhou.xyz/>)

This is a NextJS project written in Typescript.

It is a showcase of my front-end abilities plus a gallery of my other projects that I have worked on.

## About me

I am a Global Tax Consultant at a Big4 accounting firm by day and a designer / developer of cool bits and bobs by night. I pride myself on my entrepreneurial nature and enjoy learning new technologies by diving straight into fun projects across all kinds of verticals.

## Website Design

I designed the website in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/EYeJv1nYWfaQm9QSpRREVK/Jerry-Zhou?type=design&mode=design&t=76YP7G9RQwB6HWi7-0).

Key point I am trying to emphasize in my design is that when you access the webpage during work hours of 9am to 5pm, it is in light mode and representative of my day job as a Global Tax Consultant at a Big4 Accounting Firm.

At night (or when you toggle the night mode) I am a developer/designer.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
